    <h3>Introduction to the Course and Context</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Welcome to my final project for EDU 714: Course Design. For this project, I evaluated Math 15, a foundational math course tailored to support English Language Learners (ELLs) aged 18â€“20 who are new to Canada. These students often face unique challenges, including adapting to a new cultural environment, overcoming language barriers, and building foundational math skills critical for academic and career success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using <em>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</em> principles, I sought to create an inclusive and engaging course environment that prioritizes learner variability. The course's flexible structure allows students to progress at their own pace while leveraging resources designed to address their individual needs. However, there are opportunities to enhance accessibility, engagement, and representation, which this project explores in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis is informed by key readings, including Bastoni et al. (2023), who emphasize the importance of professional development in implementing UDL strategies, and Gentile & Budzilowicz (2022), who highlight the value of culturally responsive pedagogy in empowering diverse learners. By embedding these insights, the project aims to bridge gaps in course design and align Math 15 with the broader goals of inclusive education.

    <h3>Collaborative Math in Action</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Collaboration is a cornerstone of effective learning, especially in foundational courses like Math 15, where students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds must navigate new educational environments. Collaborative activities allow students to build communication skills, share problem-solving strategies, and gain confidence in their mathematical abilities. These opportunities are particularly valuable for English Language Learners (ELLs), who often benefit from peer interactions that reinforce both math concepts and language acquisition (Bastoni et al., 2023; Gentile & Budzilowicz, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
            The video below, created by <em>Brandon Woodland</em>, highlights various ways students can engage with math collaboratively. Group activities, whiteboard work, educational games, and workbook exercises all aim to achieve the same math outcomes through diverse, interactive methods. These approaches reflect Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles by offering multiple means of engagement and expression, which are critical for addressing learner variability (Sewell et al., 2022).

    <h3>Course Evaluation Based on UDL Principles</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Engagement</h4>
        <p>
            One of the key strengths of the Math 15 course is its self-paced structure, which fosters student autonomy and allows learners to take ownership of their progress. Students complete practice booklets independently, providing a clear and manageable pathway to mastering the material. This aligns with the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principle of engagement, which emphasizes the importance of choice and autonomy to sustain motivation (Bastoni et al., 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, while the self-paced nature benefits motivated students, it can leave some learners disengaged or struggling without timely support. To address this, I provide one-on-one teaching or small group instruction as needed. While this practice is valuable, incorporating regular collaborative problem-solving sessions or gamified activities, such as Kahoot, could further enhance engagement by fostering peer interaction and providing additional opportunities for active learning (Gentile & Budzilowicz, 2022).
        </p>

        <h4>Representation</h4>
        <p>
            The use of practice booklets ensures consistent delivery of content, which is essential for students learning foundational concepts. However, the reliance on a single instructional medium may not fully address the diverse needs of English Language Learners (ELLs), who make up the majority of the class. UDL emphasizes providing multiple means of representation to ensure all learners can access and understand the material effectively (Sewell et al., 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve representation, additional supports such as translated resources, visual aids, and video tutorials could be introduced. For instance, a brief instructional video accompanying each unit could help students better understand complex topics while accommodating different learning preferences. These enhancements would better align the course with UDL principles and improve accessibility for ELL students.
        </p>

        <h4>Action and Expression</h4>
        <p>
            The course currently evaluates students through unit exams, which provide a standardized measure of understanding. While this approach is effective for assessing foundational skills, it does not account for the varied ways students can demonstrate their learning. UDL encourages offering multiple means of action and expression, allowing learners to showcase their understanding in ways that align with their strengths and preferences (Gentile & Budzilowicz, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
            To align with this principle, alternative assessments such as project-based learning or student presentations could be introduced. These methods would not only diversify assessment strategies but also provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts, fostering deeper understanding and skill development.
        </p>

    <h3>Recommendations for Improvement</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Engagement</h4>
        <p>
            To further enhance student engagement, incorporating <strong>gamified activities</strong> such as Kahoot or Quizlet Live can make learning more interactive and enjoyable (Gentile & Budzilowicz, 2022). Additionally, scheduling <strong>weekly group problem-solving sessions</strong> can foster collaboration and build a sense of community among students, which is especially beneficial for English Language Learners (ELLs). These practices not only increase motivation but also create opportunities for peer learning and active participation.
        </p>

        <h4>Representation</h4>
        <p>
            While the current use of practice booklets ensures consistency, integrating <strong>multimedia resources</strong> would better align the course with UDL principles of representation (Sewell et al., 2022). For instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Video tutorials</strong> can provide step-by-step explanations for key concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual aids</strong> such as diagrams and charts can simplify complex ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Translated materials</strong> or glossaries for ELL students can bridge language barriers and improve comprehension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These additions would help cater to diverse learning needs and enhance accessibility for all students.</p>

        <h4>Action and Expression</h4>
        <p>
            To address the limitations of traditional exams as the sole form of assessment, introducing <strong>alternative assessment methods</strong> can provide students with more opportunities to demonstrate their understanding. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project-based assessments:</strong> Students could create a presentation or report applying a math concept to a real-world scenario.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-assessment tools:</strong> Allowing students to reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement encourages metacognition and ownership of learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These strategies align with UDLâ€™s emphasis on providing multiple means of action and expression, ensuring all learners can showcase their skills effectively (Bastoni et al., 2023).</p>

        <h4>Support Structures</h4>
        <p>
            Lastly, building a robust support system for students is crucial. This can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Office hours or drop-in sessions</strong> for additional help.</li>
            <li>Creating <strong>peer-mentoring opportunities</strong>, where students can support each other in understanding challenging topics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By implementing these recommendations, the Math 15 course can better meet the needs of its diverse learners, fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment.</p>
