            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my digital classroom. As a STEM teacher based in Edmonton, I'm passionate about providing you with extra resources to enhance your learning journey. I completed my Bachelor of Education program at the University of Alberta, with a major in biological sciences and minor in mathematics along with a certification in Sustainability. I am currently working on my Masters of Education specializing in Emerging Technologies. Come on in, explore, and let's embark on this educational adventure together!

            <h2>Educational Setting and Audience</h2>
            <p>
                This website is designed as a digital extension of my classroom. The primary audience for this site includes students in Grades 7 through 12 who are enrolled in Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science courses following the Alberta Program of Studies. These learners represent a diverse range of backgrounds and academic strengths, and the resources on this site aim to support them in building foundational knowledge, extending their learning beyond the classroom, and preparing for assessments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website also serves as a support tool for students, parents, and guardians by providing access to curated resources, interactive practice opportunities, and supplemental learning tools. As a STEM-focused educator with a passion for emerging technologies, I have tailored the content to engage digital-age learners through hands-on, accessible, and differentiated materials aligned with curriculum outcomes and ISTE student standards.
